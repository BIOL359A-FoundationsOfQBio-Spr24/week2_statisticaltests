    "## Hypothesis Testing Overview:\n",
    "\n",
    "Hypothesis testing is a method used to decide whether there is enough evidence to reject the null hypothesis.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Concepts and Steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Null Hypothesis ($H_0$):** This is our starting assumption, which typically suggests no effect or no difference. In mathematical terms, we express it as $H_0: \\bar{X} = \\mu$, where $\\bar{X}$ is the sample mean, and $\\mu$ is the population mean we're comparing to.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Alternative Hypothesis ($H_a$):** This represents the alternative belief, essentially what we suspect might be true instead of the null hypothesis. It's expressed as $H_A: \\bar{X} \\neq \\mu$ for a two-sided test, or $H_A: \\bar{X} > \\mu$ or $H_A: \\bar{X} < \\mu$ for one-sided tests. This hypothesis suggests there is an effect or a difference.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Test Statistic:** A numerical value calculated from the sample data, used to decide whether to reject H₀. It measures how far the observed data diverges from the null hypothesis.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Null Distribution:** This is the probability distribution of the test statistic under the assumption that the null hypothesis is true.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **P-value:** The p-value is the probability of observing a test statistic as extreme as, or more extreme than, the observed result, under the assumption that the null hypothesis is true. It quantifies how unusual our data is if $H_0$ were true. A low p-value indicates that such data would be very unlikely under the null hypothesis, suggesting evidence against $H_0$.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Significance Level (α):** Before conducting the test, we choose a significance level (often 0.05), which is the threshold used to decide whether the p-value is low enough to reject the null hypothesis. If the p-value is less than $\\alpha$, we reject $H_0$, concluding that our results are statistically significant.\n"

    "In hypothesis testing, the choice of test hinges on the comparison you're making (e.g., group differences, variable relationships, time changes) and your data's characteristics (distribution type, independence, measurement scale, sample size).

    "- **Types of Student's t-test:**\n",

    "  \n",
    "- **Null Distribution:** The test statistic follows a Student's t-distribution under the null hypothesis. The Student's t-distribution is similar to the normal distribution but with heavier tails. The shape of the t-distribution is determined by its degrees of freedom (df), which is typically the sample size - 1. With fewer degrees of freedom (smaller sample sizes), the t-distribution has heavier tails, indicating a higher probability of values further from the mean, reflecting the increased uncertainty in estimates from smaller samples. See the plot of the Student's t-distribution for different degrees of freedom plotted below."
